The program aims to achieve digit recognition using ML techniques.
Convolutional Neural Network model has been used to implement it.
For now, it has been trained using mnsit dataset of 28x28 images of digits 0-9.
For testing and training the dataset has been divided, a function to take external images is implemented, but it has to be done directly in the code, i have not yet made a convinient interface for that.

The Code mainly divides into two segments:
Implementing CNN
Training and test model

Implementation of CNN::
